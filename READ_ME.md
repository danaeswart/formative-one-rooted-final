##  Rooted – Plant Info & Chart Visualization App

**What is Rooted?**

Rooted is a data-driven web application that allows users to explore plant information fetched from a Plant API. The app visualizes plant characteristics using interactive charts with Chart.js, making it easy to compare and understand different plant metrics. It was built to demonstrate API integration, data visualization, and dynamic front-end functionality, providing a clear, engaging way to interact with plant data. The outcome is a visually informative app that presents real data in an accessible and interactive format.

### 🛠 Technical Decisions
- **React** – for modular, reusable components and state management  
- **Chart.js** – for responsive, interactive charts  
- **API Integration** – dynamic plant data ensures the app is informative and flexible

--- 

### Conclusion

**Project Highlights:**  
- Successfully integrated a **Plant API** to fetch dynamic plant data  
- Created **interactive charts** with Chart.js for visual comparison  
- Built a modular, **React-based front-end** with reusable components  

**Challenges & Solutions:**  
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| Formatting and displaying API data in charts | Used mapping functions and React state updates |
| Making charts responsive across devices | Configured Chart.js options and applied CSS styling |
| Maintaining modular code structure | Broke the UI into reusable components and managed state efficiently |

**Future Improvements / Features:**  
- Add a **search and filter** function for plants  
- Include **more plant metrics** from additional APIs  
- Implement **user accounts** to save favorite plants  
- Enhance **UI/UX** with animations and interactive tooltips
